# Ray Tracing in Rust
### :warning: This is a work in progess.

The [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book :books: has been written in **C++**. \
I've created this repo with the same working code but in **Rust**.

- [X] Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background
    - [X] The ray Class
