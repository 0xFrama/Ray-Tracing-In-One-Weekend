### :warning: This is a work in progess. :warning:

The [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book :books: has been written in **C++**. \

- [X] 4. Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background
- [X] 5. Adding a Sphere
- [ ] 6. Surface Normals and Multiple Objects
    - [ ] Shading with Surface Normals :construction: *In Progress..*
- [ ] 7. Moving Camera Code Into Its Own Class
- [ ] 8. Antialiasing
- [ ] 9. Diffuse Materials
- [ ] 10. Metal
- [ ] 11. Dieletrics
- [ ] 12. Positionable Camera
- [ ] 13. Defocus Blur
