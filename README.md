# Ray Tracing in Rust
### This is a work in progess. 

The [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book has been written in **C++**. \
I've created this repo with the same working code but in **Rust**.

This is what has been implemented so far:
1. Overview
1. Output an Image
1. The vec3 Class
1. Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background
    - The ray Class --> In Progress
