# Ray Tracing in Rust
### :warning: This is a work in progess. :warning:

The [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book :books: has been written in **C++**. \
I've created this repo with the same working code but in **Rust**.

This is what has been implemented so far:
- [X] Overview
- [X] Output an Image
- [X] The vec3 Class
- [X] Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background
- [ ] Adding a Sphere
    - [ ] Ray-Sphere Intesection :construction: *In Progress..* :construction:
